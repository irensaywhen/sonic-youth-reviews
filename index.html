                Maybe some of you know about a New York rock band named Sonic Youth. It was formed in 1981 and existed by 2011. Unlike many other bands, they dropped 32 albums, and none of them was terrible or unsuccessful. They struck a balance between experimentation and melodiousness, chaos and structure continuing experiments throughout their musical career. They developed lots of talents and influenced tons of artists. 
                I am extremely passionate about Sonic Youth. The reason why I made this page is I wanted to share my thoughts and my feelings about them and express that each of their albums is worth attention. 
                About a year and a half a was continuously thinking about ranking their albums according to my opinion. And finally, I have done that. 
                I have not included all the live albums as well as their albums from NYC Ghost and Flowers session for the sake of brevity. Here are the most popular and well-known parts of their discography. And this is what I like about this band the most: the more you are trying to listen to everything they have, the more you discover something new and extremely qualitative.

                                This album always fills me with a sense of being in a dark and cramped room shrinking down around you.

                                This is a legendary and the most popular album of the band. Firstly I found it boring and too long and complex, but after listening to it several times, I eventually realized its beauty. 
                                <br>This album is not rushing. It is slowly dipping you into noise. And it is full of Sonic Youth's most popular tracks such as Total Trash and Teenage Riot.

                                As for me, this album is one of the most easy-to-listen Sonic Youth's albums. It is dynamic and entertaining, quite short and very noisy. 
                                I find this album kinda punky and uncomplicated, but still, I adore it.

                                This is undoubtedly the most entertaining album of the band, and it contains my favorite track - Androgynous Mind.<br>
                                It is very easy to listen, and if you don't know much about Sonic Youth, I'd certainly recommend to give it a try. I think this album is still very intricate despite its easiness.

                                This album is where my Sonic Youth Listening Road starts. It is melodic, fascinating, gentle, and extremely easy to listen to. And what is very important, excluding the instrumental album SpinHead Session, this is the last release. There are a few slightly monotonous tracks, but this is the only reason why it is in tier#2.

They abandoned the no-wave genre and mostly switched to rock. A bit less impressive than Sister, but 100% worth checking.

                                I am not completely sure about its place right here. For me, this album is somewhere between tier#3 and tier#4. It is a bit peculiar. But the cover is awesome. Perfectly describes the weirdness.

                These are not my favorite. I rarely listen to them. In general, I find them tedious and unsuccessful.

                                I usually forgot about NYC Ghost&Flowers existence. And I cannot either remember or describe it. For me, It is a mess. But in general, people think it is not that bad.

                                The best thing about this album is its cover, which is one of the most memorable in Sonic Youth discography. In other aspects, I find it tedious as well as Sonic Nurse.

                                Well, honestly, I don't like this album much. It's too long. It reminds me Rather Ripped, but much more boring and uncreative. I do not understand why in general people think this album is better than others.
